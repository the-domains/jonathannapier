            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Ancient Egyptian papyrus contains earliest record of 'demon star'</h1><p>Scientists studying a 3,200 year-old papyrus document from ancient Egypt think they've found the earliest record of the variable star Algol - a three-star system that's some 92.25 light-years away from Earth.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Water bears turn into glass when they dry out</h1><p>Tardigrades - known affectionately as water bears or moss piglets - have pretty much got it all. These microscopic invertebrates are capable of surviving the most extreme conditions you could dream up, including prolonged desiccation and near-100 percent water loss, freezing and boiling temperatures, intense ionising radiation, and the vacuum of outer space.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ce7fd0cdbb3872437db9b32ed0686c3117244449.png"></article>]]></description>
